- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB (8 GB recommended)
- **Storage:** At least 500 MB of free space
- **Processor:** Dual-core CPU or higher
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading updates and datasets

## 🔍 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to use for everyone, regardless of technical experience.
- **Real-Time Results:** Get instant analysis of skin lesions using advanced algorithms.
- **Multiple Model Options:** Choose from MobileNet, ResNet, or DenseNet based on your preference.
- **Supports Multiple Formats:** Analyze images in JPG, PNG, and other common formats.
- **Transfer Learning:** Benefit from pre-trained models that enhance classification accuracy.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The application uses deep learning models trained on the HAM10000 dataset. When you upload an image of a skin lesion, the software processes it through various CNN architectures. Based on the features learned during training, it provides a classification result with confidence levels for each category.

## 📊 Understanding the Results

After processing, you'll receive a report indicating:

- **Classification:** The predicted label for the skin lesion.
- **Confidence Score:** A percentage showing how confident the model is in its prediction.
  
This helps users make informed decisions about whether to seek medical advice.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
